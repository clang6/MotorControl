Disclaimer: this project was an assignment for a class (Northwestern's ME 333 Intro to Mechatronics) rather than a personal project, but because it's relevant to my work in robotics, I'm still going to include it here on Git. I decided to add it after completing the project, so you won't see many file revisions here either.
